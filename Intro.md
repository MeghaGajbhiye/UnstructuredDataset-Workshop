# Unstructured Datasets in Autonomous Database

Welcome to the Unstructured datasets in Autonomous Database workshop. This workshop will walk you through the process of handling various unstructured datasets in Autonomous Database.

## Objectives

- Login to your Oracle Cloud Account.
- Create Autonomous Data Warehouse cloud service. 
- We will also create a user in Oracle Machine Learning (OML). We will then upload the dataset in Object Storage and will import the notebook in OML. 
- Create a User Credential in Autonomous Database through Notebook.
- Create an External table in Autonomous Database from JSON dump file. 
- Create an internal table with a JSON column with an ”is json” check constraint. Oracle recommends that you use an is_json check constraint to ensure that column values are valid JSON instances. 
- Insert JSON data from the external table into the column of internal table, and 
- Query the JSON data.
- Partition the table.
